in last two stages : the commands are 

git remote add origin (git@github.com:Mohammad-Rafi/git-practice.git)
                                        |
                                        |
                                        |
                                        \
                                         \___________  this is is a SSH link generated by the main server itself



git push -u orign main  
                    |
                    |
                    |
                    \
                     \
                      \_________________  this is the desired branch that you wish to push



now its time for another new topic called "TAGS"  --> basically this refers to a version of code released by the developers with making ceratain changes or any updates so instead of releasing new code source this is given name terms of versions 

    >> to add a TAG :  

            >> git tag -a (version_name) -m "(a valid message)"    
             ---->   -a means gives the annoted data like author , meta data , message , date .
             ---->   -m means gives the message related to the upddate or any fixing of code errors or feature added.



             after adding the tag make sure that the tags are also pushed along with the code into the github repo 

             command to push tags into the github repo : (previoius one was for how to add a tag this is how to push to server)

                >> git push origin (tagname)  : git push origin v1.0.1
