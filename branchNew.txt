here we practice about hoe to create and delete branches 

    >> i know only how to delete branches from a local repo commited ones , ones it is pushed to git hubi dont knwo that i neeed to learn them.


to create a branch two cammands both works :
    >> git swith -c (branch_name)      --> --create    also works
    >> git checkout -b (branch_name)

to get change from one branch to the other the command :
    >> git switch (branch_name)
    >> git checkout (branch_name)

if i have multiple branches , and i want to open apreviously closed branch or a branch that i have switched from recently then the command is :
    >> git switch --


to delete a branch the command:
    >> git branch -d (branch_name)


to check in branch we are in current or wanted to know total how many branaces are there locally and in remote the command is:
    >> git branch --all
    >> git branch
